## 📂 Git Hidden Folder

When you initialize a Git repository, a hidden folder named `.git` is created in the project directory. This folder contains all the metadata and history for the repository.

To create a new repository from scratch:

```bash
mkdir /workspace/tmp/new-project
cd /workspace/tmp/new-project
git init
touch ReadMe.md
open ReadMe.md   # Edit and add content to ReadMe.md
git status       # Shows tracked/untracked files
git add ReadMe.md
git commit -m "Add ReadMe.md file"
```

## 🔄 Cloning a Repository

There are three common ways to clone a repository:

1. **HTTPS**  
2. **SSH**  
3. **GitHub CLI**

**Example – HTTPS:**
```bash
mkdir /workspace/tmp
cd /workspace/tmp
git clone https://github.com/JamesStrachanTyler/github-foundations.git
cd github-foundations
ls -la
```

**Example – SSH:**
```bash
git clone git@github.com:JamesStrachanTyler/github-foundations.git
```
> 💡 You will need to set up an SSH key or use a Personal Access Token (PAT) for authentication.

## 💾 Commits

A commit records changes to the repository.

- **Commit using editor:**
```bash
git commit
```

- **Commit with message directly:**
```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

## 🌱 Branches

Branches allow you to work on different versions of your project simultaneously.

```bash
git branch new-feature
git checkout new-feature
# or in one step:
git checkout -b new-feature
```

---

## 🌐 Remotes

A remote is a reference to a hosted version of your repository (e.g., on GitHub).

```bash
git remote -v           # List remotes
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
```
